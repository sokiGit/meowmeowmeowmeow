It's just a combination of whatever I felt like adding and the architecture is whatever felt most comfortable at the 
moment. I aim to create modular code that avoids repetition and allows for consistency regardless of the underlying 
libraries used. I don't have years of experience with python, that's why you'll see stuff like declaring pages as their 
own classes inheriting from the Page class.<br/>
Here are some cool diagrams of the app's "modules" I make in figma to keep track of the app's architecture:
